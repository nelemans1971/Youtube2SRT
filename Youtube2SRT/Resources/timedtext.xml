What has it got to do with this?</text><text start="523.48" dur="1.72">We are tied to the law of physics.</text><text start="525.28" dur="3.32">Speed is vector.

together with Wang Lei&amp;#39;s speed,</text><text start="535.12" dur="1.44">friction coefficient of the grass...</text><text start="536.56" dur="1.88">and speed of rotation
and revolution of the Earth,</text><text start="539.48" dur="3.2">we can know whether Wang Lei
ran into Gu Xiao Man on purpose...</text><text start="543.04" dur="1.96">or accidentally ran into her
